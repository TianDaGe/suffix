<p>I have been looking for a way to prevent myself from commiting debug code to project repositories. I add <code>console.log</code> statements to debug problems all the time. No big deal if I would only remember to remove those lines before commiting the patch.</p>

<p>My first aproach was adding a Git <a href="http://githooks.com/" alt="What are Git hooks?">pre-commit hook</a> to warn me I was ready to commit something stupid. While this works it&apos;s a bit too intrusive to my liking. It also happens at the wrong moment: the pre-commit hook would only warn me when I was committing something, not right there when I was looking at the file.</p>

<p>Last week <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">Wynn Netherland</span> posted a way to highlight <a class="url" href="http://wynnnetherland.com/linked/2014010902/words-to-avoid-in-tech-writing" title="Words to avoid in tech writing post by Wynn Netherland">words to avoid in tech writing</a></span>, isn&apos;t that convenient?</span></p>

<p>I shamelessly took his snippet an modified it to highligt words that I don&apos;t want to commit:</p>

{% highlight vim %}
highlight DebugCode ctermfg=red guifg=red
match DebugCode /\cconsole/
autocmd BufWinEnter * match DebugCode /\cconsole/
autocmd InsertEnter * match DebugCode /\cconsole/
autocmd InsertLeave * match DebugCode /\cconsole/
autocmd BufWinLeave * call clearmatches()
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here is how how it looks with the light <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized" alt="Solarized color theme">Solarized</a> theme:</p>

<p>You might want to make sure you enabled syntax highlighting. I was missing the <code>syntax enable</code> line and it wouldn't work.</p>

{% highlight vim %}
syntax on
syntax enable
{% endhighlight %}

<p>There you go, big red boxes for lines I might want to remove before pushing this the repository.</p>

<p>A small extra tip from my <a href="https://github.com/cimm/dotvim/blob/master/vimrc" title="My .vimrc file"><code>.vimrc</code></a> file using Vim abbreviations to quickly type longer commands:</p>

{% highlight vim %}
abbr clog console.log
{% endhighlight %}
