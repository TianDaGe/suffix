<p>A few weeks ago my old and trusty <abbr title="Hewlett Packard">HP</abbr> Deskjet 3845 Color Inkjet printer died while printing some enveloppes. I don't even remember when I bought this printer, probably over 10 years ago. I happened to pass an electronics shop so went in and got me a Samsung ML-2165W for &euro;59.45. An impulsive buy.</p>

<h3>Black &amp; white laser printer</h3>

<p>I had no idea what to buy but I did know I wanted a black &amp; white laser printer. I don't print a lot, maybe 5 pages a month. Ink evaporates and cartridges are <a href="http://gizmodo.com/212444/hp-ink-costs-more-than-human-blood-booze" title="HP ink costs more than human blood" class="ext">expensive</a>. Same goes for color. As I never print photos (online print services are so cheap these days) the color ink was only used to print advertising on plane or train tickets or the occasional website. So I figured a black &amp; white printer would save me from checking the printer settings each time.</p>

<h3>Bye, bye <abbr title="Hewlett Packard">HP</abbr></h3>

<p>My previous printer served me well, why wouldn't I opt for an <abbr title="Hewlett Packard">HP</abbr> one again? The most important reason is probably their software, a driver is all I need, please don't include tons of other applications I don't need. It gives me the impression I have to pay for something I don't want. I buy a printer, not a photo manager. On top of that <abbr title="Hewlett Packard">HP</abbr> got some <a href="http://www.hpinkcartridges.co.uk/technology-blog/2012/05/hp-introduces-nano-sponge" title="HP ink sponge size over time" class="ext">bad press</a> lately. I assume they loose money on their hardware and make a ton of profit on the cartridges. Maybe all printer vendors do?</p>

<h3>ML-2165W and <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr></h3>

<p>Unpacking the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/printers/ML-2165W/XAA" class="ext">Samsung ML-2165W</a>. It has everything in the box, a power and <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cable, nice. I have seen printers where you had to buy a &lsquo;printer cable&rsquo; (= <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cable) separately in the past. Connected the printer via <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> and printed a test page. Worked out of the box. The laser printer is fast (compared with the old inkjet) and quality is what I expect from a &euro;60 printer. Not bad, not great, but certainly good enough for printing text and plane tickets. So far, so good.</p>

<h3>Wireless printing</h3>

<p>The Samsung ML-2165W is also a wireless printer. Compatible with Mac OS X. Or so they say.</p>

<p>Installed the Samsung Easy Printer Manager on Mac OS X Lion to configure the wireless settings on the printer as I don't have a router that supports <abbr title="Wi-Fi Protected Setup">WPS</abbr> (well, I do, but that's another story). The Easy Printer Manager is as unpredictable as I had feared. The printer, still connected via <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr>, didn't show up in the Easy Printer Manager. Sometimes it did, only to disappear again. The wizard did not find the printer and blamed me for not connecting the <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cable. If the printer did show up it would sometimes tell me this model did not support <abbr title="Wireless Fidelity">WIFI</abbr>. When I reboot it enough I may be able to access the WIFI settings menu. The menu does not show any wireless networks or something that looks like the settings one would expect for a wireless device. A few demotivating hours later I gave up and booted the Windows <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>. Ran the installation wizard and finished the setup process in 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Samsung, don't include Mac OS X software if you don't care about it. Don't include a support link on your website if it only refreshes the current page. Don't show 4 out of 5 star ratings if you don't show the actual reviews and almost every other review on the internet makes you look bad. Samsung, please care about your clients.</p>

<p>Once past the initial setup (thanks to Windows) it works great. All the Macs in the house pick up the printer and fetch and install the driver automatically.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>A great little printer for little money (still have to see what a new toner will cost me). It's fast and the quality is what I expect from it. Could it be improved? Sure, fixing the Mac OS X software (or leaving it out and providing a web interface) would go a long way. Having some minimal customer support or a <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> page might have made me a happy customer.</p>
