<p><a href="http://2008.dconstruct.org/" title="dConstruct 2008" class="ext">dConstruct 2008</a> is right around the corner: the Eurostar tickets are on my desk, the hostel in <abbr class="geo" title="50.8237;-0.138619">Brighton</abbr> is booked and the advertisement stuff is ready (more on this later). dConstruct by itself would be a good reason to be excited but this year there is a little extra. Last year <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn ext" href="http://www.fousa.be/" rel="friend met colleague co-resident">Fousa</a></span> and I took the dConstruct conference date as the deadline for our new sites (layout and codebase redesigns). This site went live right before we took of for dConstruct 2007 (<abbr title="20070905">September 5th, 2007</abbr>). <strong>Happy first birthday Suffix!</strong></p>

<p>Between <abbr title="20070901">September 1th, 2007</abbr> and <abbr title="20080903">yesterday</abbr> <strong>6917 people</strong> visited this website from <strong>103 different countries</strong>. They generated <strong>10691 pageviews</strong> with <strong>12 different browsers</strong> (only 2 <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" title="Google Chrome" class="ext">Google Chrome</a> visitors so far). <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/" title="StumbleUpon" class="ext">StumbleUpon</a> is my most successful referrer with <a href="http://www.flickr.com" title="Flickr Photo Sharing" class="ext">Flickr</a> following close in second position.</p>

<p>Last year I published <strong>30 blog posts</strong> or an average of 2.5 per month. The &ldquo;<a href="/blog/lightroom-iphoto-export" title="Lightroom to iPhoto export">Lightroom to iPhoto export</a>&rdquo; article is the most successful so far, &ldquo;<a href="/blog/ipodia" title="iPodia for Wikipedia">iPodia for Wikipedia</a>&rdquo; the least successful. I write most about <a href="/tags/apple" rel="tag" title="Suffix articles tagged with &lsquo;apple&rsquo;">Apple</a>, <a href="/tags/programming" rel="tag" title="Suffix articles tagged with &lsquo;programming&rsquo;">programming</a> and <a href="/tags/rubyonrails" rel="tag" title="Suffix articles tagged with &lsquo;rubyonrails&rsquo;">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, probably not very useful for anyone but it's just nice to keep around for myself and oh, happy 1<sup>st</sup> birthaday to <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn ext" href="http://www.fousa.be/" rel="friend met colleague co-resident">Fousa</a></span> as well!</p>
