<ul>
  <li>I spend most of my time at <a href="http://www.nimbly.be">nimbly</a>, my little tiny web agency.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dconstruct.org/" title="dConstruct in Brighton, UK" class="ext">Conferences</a> are a great way to pick up new things and meet great people with fantastic ideas. We organized our own one as well: twiist.be.</li>
  <li>I love to build clean, appealing, and functional (web) interfaces which comply with the latest web standards,</li>
  <li>I love to travel, as much, as far and as long as possible. Most of time without thinking and with little more than my backpack.</li>
  <li>I own a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/schoeters" title="My Flickr page" rel="me" class="ext">Canon EOS 400D</a> with an  EF-S &oslash; 18-55mm F 3.5-5.6 and EF &oslash; 50mm F 1.8 II &oslash; 52mm lens. Some technical nonsense to show my <a href="/photos">photo</a> obsession.</li>

  <li>I was born in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/schoeters/tags/leuven/" title="My Flickr photos tagged with Leuven" rel="me" class="ext">Leuven</a>, Belgium.</li>
</ul>
